Candidates may use their Chrome or Chromium browser to open one additional tab in order to
access assets at https://kubernetes.io/docs/ and its subdomain, https://github.com/kubernetes/
and its subdomains, or https://kubernetes.io/blog/. No other tabs may be opened and no other
sites may be navigated to. The allowed sites above may contain links that point to external sites.
It is the responsibility of the candidate not to click on any links that cause them to navigate to a
domain that is not allowed.

Bash Aliases
First thing when I got access to the terminal I did define aliases:


vim ~/.bashrc
# then add those two:
alias k=kubectl
alias kn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace '

vi ~/.vimrc
# then add these two lines to the file
set tabstop=2
set expandtab # use spaces for tabs

When in vim you can press Esc and type :set number or :set nonumber + Enter to toggle line numbers.

You can also just jump to a line number with Esc :22 + Enter.

For basic searching:

/pattern - search forward for pattern
?pattern - search backward
n - repeat forward search
N - repeat backward

:s/string/replacewiththisstring/g  -- single replacement
:%s/string/replacewiththisstring/g  --all occurances

Mark lines: Esc+V (then arrow keys)
Copy marked lines: y
Cut marked lines: d
Past lines: p or P
